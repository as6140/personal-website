## Overview

A machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices in King County, Washington using multiple linear regression. The model analyzes various property characteristics and location factors to provide accurate price predictions for residential real estate.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Statistical model using multiple predictor variables
- **Feature Engineering**: Analysis and selection of relevant property characteristics
- **Location Analysis**: Incorporation of geographic and neighborhood factors
- **Model Validation**: Cross-validation and performance metrics
- **Price Prediction**: Accurate estimation of home sale prices
- **Feature Importance**: Understanding which factors most influence price

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core development and analysis language
- **Scikit-learn**: Linear regression and model evaluation
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and statistical analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization and analysis
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive development and documentation

## Data Features

- **Property Characteristics**: Square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, lot size
- **Location Factors**: Zip code, latitude/longitude, neighborhood quality
- **Condition Data**: Property condition, year built, renovations
- **Market Factors**: Sale date, market conditions, seasonal effects

## Model Approach

The regression model uses:
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most predictive variables
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and outliers
- **Model Training**: Fitting the linear regression model
- **Validation**: Cross-validation to ensure model reliability
- **Performance Metrics**: R-squared, RMSE, and other evaluation metrics

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several important insights:
- Square footage is the strongest predictor of price
- Location factors significantly impact property values
- Property condition and age show complex relationships with price
- Seasonal effects influence sale prices

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was handling multicollinearity between features and ensuring the model was interpretable. The project taught me about real estate analytics and how to build practical machine learning models.

## Outcome

The model successfully predicted housing prices with good accuracy and provided insights into the factors that most influence property values in King County. The project demonstrates the value of data science in real estate analysis.
