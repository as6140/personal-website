## Overview

A comprehensive economic dashboard built with Streamlit that aggregates and visualizes key recession indicators to provide insights into economic trends and potential recession signals. The application serves as a tool for economic analysis and forecasting.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Indicator Dashboard**: Consolidates various economic indicators including yield curves, unemployment rates, GDP growth, and consumer confidence indices
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Connects to economic data APIs to provide current market information
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and graphs that allow users to explore different time periods and indicator combinations
- **Forecasting Models**: Implements statistical models to predict recession probability based on historical patterns
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface that makes complex economic data accessible

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core development language for data processing and analysis
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for creating interactive dashboards
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive data visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and statistical analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models for forecasting
- **Economic Data APIs**: Integration with various economic data sources

## Economic Indicators Tracked

- **Yield Curve Inversions**: 2-year vs 10-year Treasury yields
- **Unemployment Rate Trends**: Historical and current unemployment data
- **GDP Growth**: Quarterly GDP growth rates and trends
- **Consumer Confidence**: Consumer sentiment and spending indicators
- **Manufacturing Index**: PMI and industrial production data
- **Housing Market**: Home sales, construction, and mortgage rates

## Technical Implementation

The application uses a modular architecture with separate components for:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and modeling
- Visualization generation
- User interface and interaction

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was handling the lag in economic data reporting and ensuring the dashboard provided timely insights. The project taught me about economic indicator relationships and how to build user-friendly interfaces for complex financial data.

## Outcome

The dashboard successfully provides a comprehensive view of economic health and has been used for both personal investment decisions and educational purposes. It demonstrates the value of consolidating multiple data sources into actionable insights.
