# Solo Quant: Personal Quantitative Trading Infrastructure

## Overview

Solo Quant is an ambitious project to build a complete quantitative trading infrastructure from the ground up. The goal is to create a personal trading system that can go from idea generation to automated execution, incorporating data collection, strategy development, backtesting, risk management, and live trading capabilities.

## Project Vision

### End-to-End Trading System
The ultimate goal is to build a comprehensive quantitative trading platform that includes:

- **Data Pipeline**: Real-time and historical market data collection
- **Strategy Development**: Research and backtesting environment
- **Risk Management**: Position sizing and portfolio optimization
- **Execution Engine**: Automated order placement and management
- **Performance Analytics**: Real-time P&L and strategy monitoring

### Current Status: Work in Progress

This project is currently in active development. The infrastructure is being built incrementally, with core components being developed and tested before moving to more advanced features.

## Planned Architecture

### Data Layer
- **Market Data**: Real-time price feeds from multiple exchanges
- **Alternative Data**: News sentiment, economic indicators, social media
- **Historical Data**: Clean, normalized historical price and volume data
- **Data Storage**: Efficient time-series database for fast querying

### Strategy Layer
- **Research Environment**: Jupyter notebooks for strategy development
- **Backtesting Engine**: Historical simulation with realistic slippage and fees
- **Strategy Library**: Collection of tested and validated strategies
- **Performance Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, drawdown analysis, risk metrics

### Execution Layer
- **Order Management**: Smart order routing and execution
- **Risk Controls**: Position limits, stop-losses, portfolio constraints
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live P&L tracking and alerting
- **Compliance**: Regulatory reporting and audit trails

### Infrastructure
