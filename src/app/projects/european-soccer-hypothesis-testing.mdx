## Overview

A comprehensive statistical analysis project examining European soccer data to test various hypotheses about the sport. The project uses SQL, Python, and statistical methods to investigate home-field advantage, optimal formations, and inter-league performance differences.

## Key Features

- **Home-Field Advantage Analysis**: Statistical testing of whether home teams have a significant advantage
- **Formation Optimization**: Analysis of different tactical formations and their effectiveness
- **Inter-League Comparison**: Statistical comparison of performance across different European leagues
- **SQL Data Processing**: Complex queries to extract and analyze match data
- **Statistical Testing**: Hypothesis testing using various statistical methods
- **Data Visualization**: Clear presentation of findings through charts and graphs

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Database queries and data extraction
- **Python**: Statistical analysis and data processing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Statistical computing and hypothesis testing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scipy**: Statistical testing and analysis
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive development and documentation

## Hypotheses Tested

1. **Home-Field Advantage**: Do home teams perform significantly better than away teams?
2. **Optimal Formations**: Which tactical formations lead to the best performance?
3. **Inter-League Competencies**: How do different leagues compare in terms of playing style and effectiveness?

## Data Sources

- **Match Data**: Historical match results, scores, and statistics
- **Team Information**: Formation data, team characteristics
- **League Data**: Different European leagues and their characteristics
- **Performance Metrics**: Goals, possession, shots, and other match statistics

## Statistical Methods

- **T-Tests**: Comparing home vs away performance
- **ANOVA**: Testing formation effectiveness
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between variables
- **Regression Analysis**: Modeling performance factors
- **Confidence Intervals**: Quantifying uncertainty in findings

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several interesting insights:
- Home-field advantage is statistically significant but varies by league
- Certain formations show consistent performance advantages
- Inter-league differences are more pronounced than expected
- Performance metrics correlate differently across leagues

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was handling the complexity of soccer data and ensuring statistical rigor. The project taught me about sports analytics and how to apply statistical methods to real-world problems.

## Outcome

The analysis provided insights into soccer performance factors and demonstrated the value of data-driven approaches in sports analytics. The project has been used for educational purposes and sports analytics research.
