- **Transaction Costs**: Including realistic trading costs reduced strategy performance by [W]%

## Technical Implementation

### Backtesting Framework
```python
class StrategyBacktester:
    def __init__(self, data, initial_capital):
        self.data = data
        self.capital = initial_capital
        self.positions = {}
        self.portfolio_value = []
    
    def run_strategy(self, strategy):
        for date, row in self.data.iterrows():
            signals = strategy.generate_signals(row)
            self.execute_trades(signals, date)
            self.update_portfolio_value(date)
        
        return self.calculate_performance_metrics()
    
    def calculate_performance_metrics(self):
        returns = pd.Series(self.portfolio_value).pct_change()
        return {
            'total_return': (self.portfolio_value[-1] / self.capital) - 1,
            'sharpe_ratio': returns.mean() / returns.std() * np.sqrt(252),
            'max_drawdown': self.calculate_max_drawdown(),
            'volatility': returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)
        }
```

### Machine Learning Integration
```python
class MLStrategy:
    def __init__(self, model, features):
        self.model = model
        self.features = features
    
    def generate_signals(self, market_data):
        # Prepare features
        X = self.extract_features(market_data)
        
        # Generate predictions
        prediction = self.model.predict(X)
        confidence = self.model.predict_proba(X)
        
        # Convert to trading signals
        if prediction > 0.6 and confidence.max() > 0.7:
            return 'BUY'
        elif prediction < 0.4 and confidence.max() > 0.7:
            return 'SELL'
        else:
            return 'HOLD'
```

## Challenges and Learnings

### Data Quality Challenges
- **Survivorship Bias**: Historical data often excludes delisted companies
- **Look-ahead Bias**: Ensuring no future information leaks into strategy signals
- **Data Snooping**: Avoiding overfitting by using proper train/test splits

### Market Realities
- **Transaction Costs**: Real trading involves commissions, spreads, and market impact
- **Liquidity Constraints**: Large positions may not be executable at desired prices
- **Market Microstructure**: Understanding bid-ask spreads and order book dynamics

### Model Limitations
- **Non-stationarity**: Market relationships change over time
- **Regime Changes**: Strategies that work in one market environment may fail in another
- **Overfitting**: Complex models may perform well in-sample but poorly out-of-sample
