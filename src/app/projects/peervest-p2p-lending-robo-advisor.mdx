# PeerVest: P2P Lending Robo-Advisor

## Overview

PeerVest is a free machine learning application that helps investors pick the best loan pools on peer-to-peer lending platforms like LendingClub and Prosper Marketplace. The system uses advanced ML models to provide more granular, continuous risk assessments compared to the discrete, grouped buckets typically offered by these platforms.

## The Problem

Peer-to-peer lending marketplaces are incentivized to increase transaction volume, leading to simplified credit risk assessments that group loans into broad buckets. This approach is inefficient given each loan's uniqueness and the wealth of borrower data available. A more granular, continuous risk assessment system could significantly improve investment decisions.

## Technical Architecture

### Dual Model Approach

**Model 1: Neural Network (Probability of Default)**
- **Architecture**: 5-layer neural network with 1,107 input features
- **Performance**: 96.1% F1-Score, 0.86 ROC-AUC
- **Purpose**: Predicts likelihood of loan default

**Model 2: Random Forest (Annualized Returns)**
- **Performance**: R² = 0.56 (without payment history), R² = 0.97 (with payment history)
- **Purpose**: Predicts expected annualized returns

### Key Features

- **Shrop Ratio**: Custom risk-adjusted return metric using probability of default instead of standard deviation
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Live integration with LendingClub.com
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Recommendations for optimal diversification (100+ loans)
- **Web Application**: Deployed on AWS EC2 with Flask backend

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Features**: 1,107 engineered features from borrower data
- **Training Data**: Historical LendingClub loan performance data
- **Validation**: Cross-validation and out-of-sample testing

### Model Training
- **Neural Network**: Keras implementation with early stopping and class balancing
- **Random Forest**: GridSearchCV optimization for hyperparameter tuning
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Flask web application
- **Hosting**: Amazon Web Services EC2
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Brython for client-side Python
- **Live URL**: [www.peervest.online](http://www.peervest.online)

## Results & Impact

### Model Performance
- **Default Prediction**: 94.3% precision, 97.9% recall for fully paid loans
- **Return Prediction**: 56% R² without payment history, 97% R² with payment history
- **Risk Assessment**: More granular than marketplace's grouped risk buckets

### Investment Benefits
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Custom Shrop Ratio for better portfolio optimization
- **Diversification**: Recommendations for 100+ loan portfolios
- **Real-time Updates**: Live integration with current loan listings

## Technical Challenges Overcome

### Model Development
- **Overfitting**: Addressed through regularization and early stopping
- **Feature Engineering**: Created 1,107 meaningful features from raw data
- **Class Imbalance**: Implemented class weight balancing for default prediction

### Deployment Challenges
- **Real-time Integration**: Connected to live LendingClub API
- **Scalability**: AWS EC2 hosting for web application
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface for non-technical investors

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Performance Tracking**: Compare recommendations vs. marketplace defaults
- **Mission-Driven Filtering**: Filter by loan purpose for impact investing
- **Visual Analytics**: Dashboard showing portfolio diversification metrics
- **Automated Execution**: Python code output for automated order execution
- **Market Analysis**: Interest rate correlation with federal funds rates

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Brython
- **Cloud**: Amazon Web Services (EC2)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Persistence**: Joblib

## Key Learnings

This project demonstrated the power of combining multiple ML approaches for financial applications. The neural network excelled at classification tasks (default prediction), while the random forest provided robust regression capabilities (return prediction). The custom Shrop Ratio metric showed how domain-specific risk measures can outperform traditional financial ratios.

The deployment challenges highlighted the importance of creating user-friendly interfaces for complex ML applications, making sophisticated investment tools accessible to everyday investors.
